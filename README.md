	A tiny, toy‐grade concatenative language implemented in pure `Python` -- `mohito` is all about razor‑thin minimalism and learning by doing. It’s under 1000 lines of code, driven by quotations and a handful of core primitives (arithmetic, stack ops, control flow), and was born as a weekend hack to explore how concatenative evaluators work. Don’t expect production tooling—no module system, no rich IDE support, just a bare‐bones REPL, a handful of built‑ins, and error messages that point you straight at the offending code. If you’ve ever wondered how forth‑style languages glue together parsers, runtimes, and vocabularies, `mojito` is the perfect little sandbox.
